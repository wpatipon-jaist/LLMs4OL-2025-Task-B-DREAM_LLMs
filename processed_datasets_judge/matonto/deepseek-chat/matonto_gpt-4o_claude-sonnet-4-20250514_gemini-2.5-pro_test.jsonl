Therefore, it signifies an absorbed dose unit.\n\nclaude-sonnet-4-20250514 prediction:\nType: unit\nReason: Gray per second (Gy/s) is a unit representing absorbed dose rate, measuring the rate at which ionizing radiation energy is absorbed per unit mass over time.

Since dose rate isn't among the specific categories, it's classified as a general unit.\n\ngemini-2.5-pro prediction:\nType: unit\nReason: The term 'gray per second' denotes a unit of measurement for the absorbed dose rate.
