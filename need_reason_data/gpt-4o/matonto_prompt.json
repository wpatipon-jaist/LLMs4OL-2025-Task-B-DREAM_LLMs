  "prompt": "I want you to give me the reasons why you have predicted those types from terms based on uses the Material Ontology to classify materials, processes, and properties in material science.\n\nNow I want to give you all 49 possibles answers:\n- force unit\n- radiant intensity unit\n- permittivity unit\n- temperature unit\n- volume unit\n- energy density unit\n- catalytic activity unit\n- amount of substance unit\n- magnetic field strength\n- molar energy unit\n- electric field strength unit\n- luminous intensity unit\n- magnetic flux unit\n- angular velocity unit\n- entropy unit\n- pressure unit\n- absorbed dose unit\n- specific volume unit\n- specific energy unit\n- volume density unit\n- angular acceleration unit\n- length unit\n- irradiance unit\n- radiance unit\n- power unit\n- inductance unit\n- velocity unit\n- time unit\n- information unit\n- solid angle unit\n- electric charge unit\n- luminance unit\n- plane angle unit\n- dynamic viscosity unit\n- energy unit\n- mass unit\n- electric current unit\n- acceleration unit\n- capacitance unit\n- catalytic concentration unit\n- potential difference unit\n- electric conduction unit\n- illuminance unit\n- magnetic flux density unit\n- electric resistance unit\n- dose equivalent unit\n- unit\n- permeability unit\n- luminous flux unit\n\nNow I will give you your predictions and you will answer with no explanation and in one line for example { \"id\": \"ANSWER_ID\", \"types\": [\"ANSWER\"] } Additionally, provide a brief reason (up to 100 words) in the format: \"reason\": \"...\". The response must be correct json structure. Display it as a json code not text. Don't predict new type just repeat the data i am going to give you. If you understand just say text \"Ready!\" (don't display json for this)"
